# Playgrounds

Apple Xcode Playgrounds are perfect for quick and dirty exploration of iOS, macOS, and general software development explorations... ok, _perfect_ might be a little to strong a word here!

I'd like Playgrounds to include better debugging tools and the ability to compile to standalone, sharable _applets_. There is a ton of functionality in Playgrounds but it's hard to marshal because Xcode doesn't make building a sophisticaed playground as easy as an iOS app! But if/when Apple addresses these minor shortcommings, I'd probably just do Playgrounds all day long.

But enough grousing!

## AlertAndActionsPlayground.playground

Exploring the SDK what Apple provides with alerts actions

## DynamicAnimatorPlayground.playground

Exploring dynamic UI behavior animations provided by UIDynamicAnimator (from a WWDC contest a few years back)

## fizz-buzz.playground

Swift 5 features make FizzBuzz too easy by half!

## FuctionalPlayground.playground

Swift functions that apply functions to transfom value (with Generics)!
